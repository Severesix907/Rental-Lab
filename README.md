## Project Intro/Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the impact of proximity to transportation-related amenities on the pricing dynamics of rental units. Additionally, a significant consideration will be given to the influence of individuals who maintain an animal as their closest companion, exploring its consequential effect on rental prices. This research endeavors to shed light on the intricate interplay between these variables, aiming to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the pricing structure of rental properties.

## Project Description
Throughout the course of this project, I employed the utilization of Pandas and Seaborn to effectively cleanse and visualize the data. This process involved meticulous examination to ensure the seamless functionality of my program and to identify and rectify any errors that arose during the analysis.

An essential consideration that surfaced during the project pertained to the accuracy of the data, which relied heavily on contributions from external sources. This prompted a pivotal inquiry into the reliability of the submitted data, a crucial aspect in determining the veracity of the results obtained.

One noteworthy inference drawn from the analysis was the discernible impact of various factors on rental prices. Notably, the heightened demand for rental units in more rural areas was observed to correlate with increased transportation accessibility, facilitating daily commutes, work obligations, and proximity to amenities. Additionally, a correlation between elevated rental costs and urban areas emerged, attributed to a greater array of recreational and commercial opportunities.

However, it is imperative to acknowledge the challenges encountered during the analysis phase. An issue of significance revolved around the prevalence of missing data, necessitating meticulous efforts to address and rectify gaps in the dataset. These efforts, while essential for data completeness, occasionally led to alterations in the visual representation of findings, introducing a degree of complexity in ensuring accuracy.
